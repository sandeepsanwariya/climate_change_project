Investigators suspected that the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) was responsible for the attack, and even arrested some suspects. However, the MILF denied involvement and instead blamed the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) for the attacks. An alternate theory claimed that Abu Sayyaf had indeed perpetrated the bombings and would continue to commit such acts until their leaders were released. A final theory blamed members of the police and Philippine's Senate for the attacks. However, in May 2003, a detailed terrorist Saifulla Unos involved in MILF and with links to al-Qa'ida admitted to leading the attacks in Manila in 2000. A fourth blast occurred at a cargo handling facility at Manila's international airport. No one was injured in this incident. On 2 August, two men were arrested and implicated in connection with all of these bombings. These men, Mamasao Naga and Abdul Pata have ties to the Jemaah Islamiah (JI) terrorist group.",

    "description": "February 2004 Moscow Metro bombing: A blast tore apart a metro train car in Moscow during the morning rush hour. The train was traveling between the Paveletskaya station and the Avtozavodskaya station around 8:40 am. The explosion occurred in the second car of the train, blowing out windows and causing metal pieces of the train to be strewn in all directions. The device had an explosive power of about 4–5 kg of TNT. The device was similar to that used in the commuter train attack in Yessentuki in 2003. Those who survived were forced to walk through the dark tunnel to exit the subway. At least forty people were killed and 122 injured. However, the death toll was expected to rise as many bodies had been torn apart during the explosion and were difficult to identify. Police believe that they have surveillance video of two of the perpetrators. The video shows two suspicious looking people boarding the train with briefcases. In addition to these two people, police had also identified one other suspect, also a woman. The main theory of investigators was that the blast was perpetrated by suicide bombers, probably the two women companions of the man caught on video. However, other theories, including the possibility that the bomb was set on time delay and placed in a briefcase, were also being considered. Police had released a photograph of the male suspect. On February 8, the case was transferred to the FSB, as officials felt that they were unlikely to find the suspect in Moscow. Instead, they were hoping to gain information from other regions. Although Russian officials believe that Chechen rebels were behind the attack, particularly terrorists affiliated with Abu al-Walid al-Ghalidi, Chechen leaders deny involvement. Some officials speculated that the attack had occurred in an attempt to disrupt the upcoming March elections. Putin vowed that this would not happen. There was also some speculation that there was a connection between al-Qaida and this incident. On March 1, several sources reported that a previously unknown terrorist group, known as Gazoton-Murdash (a Chechen group), claimed responsibility for the incident. A statement was received first on February 8, and then several times after that. Kavkaz-Tzentr did not publish the letter until it had been received three times along with a phone call. The leader of the group said that the attack was intended to commemorate the fourth anniversary of the killing of Chechen civilians by Russian soldiers who took control of Groznyy. Chechen authorities were unsure if the group was a valid organization and were attempting to ascertain the true identity of the group leader, Lom-Ali Chechensky, and determine if the claim of responsibility is accurate. On March 4, Izvestiya reported that the statement of Lom-Ali was actually a reaction to the reported killing of Ruslan Gelayev in Dagestan. The source stated that this claim of responsibility was only propaganda, used to deflect attention from the killing of Gelayev and as retaliation for Russian propaganda. On September 28, Officials announced that they believed Anzor Izhayev was responsible for the blast. They believe that he died in the attack. The suspicion was based on genetic tests.",

There is no belief that this attack is connected to larger al Qaeda attacks in Istanbul in December 2003. By March 13, authorities had arrested fifteen people in connection with this attack, including two who had received military training in Afghanistan. CNN reports that the Abu Hafs al-Masri Brigade, the same group that claimed responsibility for the March 11 Madrid train bombings, also claimed responsibility for this incident.

At least one of these bombs detonated at El Pozo, a small commuter station in Madrid. It is impossible to disaggregate the casualties from any of the blast sites because of poor reporting. The bombs were detonated by cell phones and were left in backpacks. At first the Spanish government blamed the separatist group, the Basque Fatherland and Freedom (ETA) for the attacks, but later the Abu Hafs al-Masri Brigade claimed responsibility on behalf of Al Qaeda. By the end of March 2004, authorities had arrested over twenty people in connection with the attack. The suspects hailed from Morocco, Pakistan, Syria and Spain. In their claim of responsibility, the Abu Hafs al-Masri Brigade says that Spain was targeted because of their cooperation with the US in the war in Iraq. In response to the attacks, the ruling Spanish party was defeated in elections mainly because they lied about those attacks(which took place four days after the incident) and the new Prime Minister vowed to remove Spanish troops from combat in Iraq. On April 3, as the police were closing in on four suspects, including Serjame ben Abdelmajid Fakhet, who they believe was the ringleader in this incident, the suspects blew themselves up in their apartment in Madrid. This blast also killed a police officer. One suspect managed to escape the apartment explosion, as he was taking out the trash at the time of the raid. Abdelmajid Bouchar escaped to Serbia, where he hid out until he was captured in August 2005.",

Kadyrov was elected last fall in what was considered by many to be a fraudulent vote. The explosion was caused by a bomb planted inside a concrete pillar and occurred at 10:35am during a parade and concert in Groznyy celebrating the 59th anniversary of the victory of Germany in World War 2. The blast tore a hole in the section designate for dignitaries. It was not clear if the explosion was specifically targeting Kadyrov or whether it would have occurred regardless of his presence, as he was not officially scheduled to be at this event. Khussein Isayev, chairman of the Republic's state council, and Adlan Khasanov, a reported for Reuters, were also killed in the blast. Col. Gen. Valery Baranov, the commander of the Russian military in the northern Caucasus was gravely wounded. Although estimates of total casualties varied, at least ten people were killed and around fifty more injured. These numbers include many civilians and WW2 veterans who were also attending the celebrations. Officials believe that the blast was detonated by remote control and was intentionally installed below the VIP section. The bomb may have been planted some time ago during the recent renovations to the stadium. Preliminary reports suggest that the bomb was equivalent to one ton of TNT. The location of the bomb made it impossible for existing equipment to detect. The type of explosive appeared identical to the type used to blow up the military parade two years ago in the Dagestani city of Kaspiysk. Rescue workers prevented two other blasts in the stadium. They were able to defuse another landmine and an additional explosive device equipped with a timer set to go off 30 minutes after the first explosion. On May 12, another explosive device was found in the half-ruined Dynamo Stadium. The device consisted of TNT charges and pieces of metal. It was unclear if the device had been planted recently or a long time ago. Rebel leader Shamil Basayev claimed that he was involved in and had organized the blast. The attack may have been intended to sow panic and disorder among the Chechen leadership. Initial investigations were focusing on the security staff at the stadium and the builders who took part in the renovations of the stadium. Investigators believe that insufficient training and organization of the security staff was faulted for allowing the attack to occur. Officials had detained at least five individuals for potential involvement in the attack, including Ibragim Musayev, who was also involved in the hostage-taking raid of the Dubrovka Theatre and the bomb attack near a McDonald's in Moscow. Investigators had also given a more specific list of suspects who were under investigation to the Russian Duma. The Russian appointed Prime Minister, Sergei Abramov will serve as President until new elections are held sometime before September, as stipulated by the republic's constitution. The attack serves a blow to Putin and his strategy for ending the conflict in Chechnya. On August 5, Interfax reported that three suspects had been arrested in connection with the attack, two of whom had already confessed to the crime. The third man was arrested later than the other two and was providing investigators with useful information.",

In the early morning, four militants wearing military-style clothing stormed the oil industry office compounds spraying gunfire and killing thirteen people. The militants then moved up the street to Oasis Residential Resort. According to the Saudi Interior Ministry, the militants first tried to ram the gate with an explosives-rigged car but when that failed they scaled the wall. They then proceeded to sort out Muslims from non-Muslims and corralled at least fifty hostages in a hotel. Nine hostages were killed and forty-one rescued by Saudi commandos. Only one of the attackers was captured. Al-Qaeda has claimed responsibility for the attack.",

The same group, the Islambouli Brigade of Martyrs claimed responsibility for the attack. Eleven people were killed in the attack and at least fifty wounded. The suicide bomber was identified as Roza Magayeva, the sister of Aminat Nagayev who is believed to be responsible for one of the two airliner crashes. Later, officials reported that Nikolay Kipkeyev was one of the victims of the blast. Kipkeyev was on the MVD wanted list for participation in illegal and terrorist-related activity.

Army radio said that the three gunmen had earlier crossed into the country from the checkpoint; hospital spokespersons also added that approximately six people had \"light\" injuries and another four people had \"medium\" injuries. Police said the second attack occurred on a military vehicle which went over a roadside bomb; though they added that they did not know the number of injuries nor their conditions. In the third attack, an anti-tank missile was said to have been launched on a private car 20 km north of the first shooting, resulting in five deaths. Some local media reports suggested mortar fire emanated from Egypt.\nDefense Minister Ehud Barak said that while the Israeli army was assessing the security situation along the border with Egypt he vowed to \"hunt down\" the perpetrators of the attack and that he held Gazans responsible for the attacks, prompting expectations of a \"harsh Israeli military reaction against the Gaza Strip.\" In turn, Ahmad Yousef of Hamas in Gaza denied responsibility for the attacks even though Hamas \"praises the attack since it attacked Israeli soldiers and came in the right time while Israel is attacking Gaza almost every day. Since the whole political process is frozen, military escalation is the logical development.\"",
